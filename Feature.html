        <h1>PassGuard Features</h1>
        <div class="features">
            <div class="feature">
                <h2>Secure Vault</h2>
                <p>The Secure Vault is the core feature of PassGuard, where users store all their sensitive data, including passwords, credit card information, and other private details. This vault uses robust encryption techniques to ensure that all data is secure. End-to-end encryption means that your data is encrypted before it leaves your device and remains encrypted until it reaches your device again. Only you can decrypt and access this information using your Master Password, which is never stored or transmitted by PassGuard.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensures that even if data is intercepted or accessed by unauthorized parties, it remains unreadable without the Master Password.</li>
                    <li>Protects against data breaches and unauthorized access.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h2>Advanced Password Generator</h2>
                <p>PassGuard includes an advanced password generator that helps users create strong, unique passwords for each of their accounts. Users can customize the length and complexity of the passwords, including options for special characters, numbers, and uppercase letters.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Generates passwords that are resistant to brute-force attacks and guessing.</li>
                    <li>Reduces the risk of using weak or repeated passwords across multiple sites.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h2>Autofill and Auto-Save</h2>
                <p>The Autofill and Auto-Save features streamline the process of entering and storing credentials. When a user visits a login page, PassGuard can automatically fill in their credentials. Additionally, new passwords and login details can be saved automatically when a user creates or changes them.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Saves time and reduces the hassle of remembering and entering passwords manually.</li>
                    <li>Ensures that login credentials are consistently stored securely.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h2>Cross-Device Sync</h2>
                <p>This feature allows users to synchronize their passwords and other vault data across multiple devices, such as desktops, smartphones, and tablets. Changes made on one device are automatically updated on all others.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provides seamless access to passwords and data regardless of the device being used.</li>
                    <li>Ensures that users have the most up-to-date information across all their devices.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h2>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>
                <p>Two-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification in addition to the Master Password. This could be a code sent to a mobile device or an authentication app.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enhances account security by making it harder for unauthorized users to gain access.</li>
                    <li>Provides additional protection even if the Master Password is compromised.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h2>Secure Notes</h2>
                <p>Secure Notes allows users to store sensitive information that doesnâ€™t fit into a traditional password format, such as recovery codes, security questions, or personal notes. These notes are encrypted just like passwords.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keeps all sensitive information in one secure location.</li>
                    <li>Protects personal notes and important codes with encryption.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h2>Data Breach Monitoring</h2>
                <p>Data Breach Monitoring alerts users if their credentials or personal information appear in known data breaches. This feature helps users take action quickly to secure their accounts if their information is compromised.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provides proactive alerts about potential security risks.</li>
                    <li>Helps users to promptly change passwords or take other protective measures.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h2>Biometric Login</h2>
                <p>Biometric Login enables users to access their PassGuard account using biometric authentication, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, on supported devices.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Offers a faster and more convenient way to log in.</li>
                    <li>Enhances security by using biometric data, which is difficult to replicate or steal.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h2>Emergency Access</h2>
                <p>Emergency Access allows users to designate trusted contacts who can access their vault in case of emergency. This ensures that critical information is available to those who may need it, such as family members or legal representatives.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provides peace of mind that important information can be accessed if something happens to the user.</li>
                    <li>Ensures that designated contacts can access necessary data in urgent situations.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h2>Easy Password Import</h2>
                <p>This feature allows users to easily import passwords and other data from other password managers into PassGuard. It simplifies the transition process for users moving from a different service.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eases the migration process and reduces the time required to switch to PassGuard.</li>
                    <li>Ensures that users do not lose their stored data when changing password managers.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
